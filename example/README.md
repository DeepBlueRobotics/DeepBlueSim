This is the `example` project generated by WPILib, modified to support running of a system test as a dependency of the `check` (and thus indirectly the `build`) Gradle task.
**NOTE: For the system test to pass, Webots must be running the `Webots/worlds/Test.wbt` world. If it isn't, the test will wait for 135 seconds
for it to be started before failing with a timeout error.**
